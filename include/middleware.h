/// The Middleware class is a base-class designed to be extended by any class
/// wishing to manipulate SIP messages passing between the SproutletWrapper and
/// an applicatio-specific child of SproutletTsx.  The presence of one or more
/// Middleware classes is transparent to both the SproutletWrapper and the
/// SproutletTsx.  This class represents a no-op implementation of a Middleware
/// class, simply passing all calls made against the SproutletTsx interface up
/// to the SproutletTsx object above it, and passing all calls made against the
/// SproutletTsxHelper interface down to the SproutletTsxHelper object below
/// it.  A given Middleware object cannot tell whether the objects above and
/// below it are actually the real SproutletTsx and the SproutletWrapper, or
/// just other Middleware objects, as both present exactly the same interfaces.
///
/// TODO - Should we prevent some of these methods from being overriden?  It
/// isn't obvious why it should be OK to intercept some of these (non-SIP)
/// requests.
///
/// TODO - If we notify a modified initial request up to the SproutletTsx, then
/// we really ought to return copies of this when original_request() is later
/// called.  Seems like this would be easy to get wrong when writing a new
/// middleware layer that modifies initial requests...
